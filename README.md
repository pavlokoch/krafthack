About the sensors available. We are considering one out of 4 units. 

*Power* is the power (watt (joule/s)) generated by the unit. 

*Reactive power* is either generated or absorbed by electric generators to maintain a constant voltage level, commonly referred to as providing “voltage support.” From the viewpoint of efficiency, reactive power may be seen as power loss

*Guide vanes* Adjust the turbine load by adjusting blades that directes the water. Adjusting the vanes will increase or decrease the flow rate through the turbine. Guide vanes are not stationary, they change their angle as per the requirement to control the angle of striking of water to turbine blades to increase the efficiency. They also regulate the flow rate of water into the runner blades thus controlling the power output of a turbine according to the load on the turbine. OBS: They control the angle and amout of water allowed to enter the runner from the water inlet. 

*Draft tube* This is located at the exit end of the turbine and helps to throughput the "used" water. It is at the exit end of the turbine increasing the pressure of the exiting fluid at the expense of its velocity. Think windmills where the air must have some remaining momentum to escape. 

*spiral casing* The spiral casing is the inlet medium of water to the turbine. he water flowing from the reservoir or dam is made to pass through this pipe with high pressure. The blades of the turbines are circularly placed, which means the water striking the turbine’s blades should flow in the circular axis for efficient striking. So the spiral casing is used, but due to the circular movement of the water, it loses its pressure.

*rotational speed* Water enters these turbines radially meaning that it enters the turbine perpendicular to the rotational axis. Once entering the turbine, the water always flows inwards, towards the center. Once the water has flown through the turbine, it exits axially, parallel to the rotational axis.
